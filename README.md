# Computer-Graphics-Mini-Project
### Topic : Implementing the concept of Solar Power and Solar Energy

Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures, lines, charts using computer with the help of
programming. Computer graphics is made up of number of pixels. Pixel is the smallest
graphical picture or unit represented on the computer screen. Basically, there are two types of
computer graphics namely. Usually, the term refers to computer generated image data created
with the help from specialized graphical hardware and software. It is a vast and recent area in
computer science.

Our objective is to simulate the working of solar energy and power in real life situation using
OpenGL library. In this simulation, we try to show normal events that happen everyday in
real life. We are using different OpenGL transformations to implement these events.

We have made use of Code::Blocks, C language and OpenGL library functions to implement
our project. This is because it allows graphics to run and manage on various applications and
multiple platforms. It is easier to draw objects, assign colors, zoom in and zoom out,
transforming objects. This allows us to simulate our project.

Developing this project helped us to learn about the computer graphics practically and to add realistic
animations required for the project. The project is user friendly and has features which can be easily
understood by the user. It demonstrates the OpenGL applications in 2D with animation.
